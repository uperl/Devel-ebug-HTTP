A debugger is a computer program that is used to debug other
programs. [Devel::ebug](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::ebug) is a simple, extensible Perl debugger with a
clean API. [Devel::ebug::HTTP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::ebug::HTTP) is a web-based frontend to [Devel::ebug](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::ebug) which
presents a simple, pretty way to debug programs. [ebug\_http](https://metacpan.org/pod/ebug_http) is 
the command line program to launch the debugger. It will return a URL
which you should point a web browser to.
